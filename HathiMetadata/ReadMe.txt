ReadMe.txt for /HathiMetadata

A script we used to mine metadata from the .jsons provided by Hathi. This was written by Mike Black, rather than Ted Underwood.

Lots of niggling format issues here.

[Note: the script has a weakness with titles -- it sometimes only gets the short version of a title if there's a colon or semicolon. I'm about to fix that (-Ted)]
