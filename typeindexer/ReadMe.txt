ReadMe.txt

This was part of the process of generating OCR rules. I wanted to start by getting a list of all the "types" aka token forms in the collection, along with associated data like, Is this type usually titlecased? and What's the average OCR quality of volumes where it appears? (Figuring that tokens that appear only in crappy volumes are likely errors)

To be honest I forget which of these scripts was the final version I used. This part of the process was a bit of an ad-hoc mess, and broke into several stages, so what I've done is just give you a copy of the whole folder instead of trying to extract the final polished version. Sorry for crappy documentation here :)
