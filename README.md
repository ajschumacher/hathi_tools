### hathi_tools

Tools for working with [Hathi Trust](http://www.hathitrust.org/) data.

These tools are under development. They have been developed thus far by the intrepid [Ted Underwood](http://www.english.illinois.edu/people/tunder) and [Mike Black](http://www.english.illinois.edu/people/black7) at [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/). They were first mentioned online in a [blog post](http://tedunderwood.com/2012/07/27/getting-everything-you-want-from-hathitrust/).
